## Why visibility in AI search matters

When users ask ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Claude for recommendations, your brand either shows up or it doesn't. **Visibility** is how often you're mentioned. **Citations** are the sources AI points to — your site, reviews, press, or competitors. Pierview gives you the data to improve both.
