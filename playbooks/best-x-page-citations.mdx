title: "Create a Best X Page That Earns Citations"
description: "Structure, criteria, FAQs — what AI likes. Measure success in Pierview."

## Purpose

"Best X" pages are highly citeable. AI models look for structured, comparative content with clear criteria. This playbook outlines how to build a page that earns citations — and how to measure it in Pierview.

## Page structure

1. **Intro** — What the page covers and who it's for (1–2 short paragraphs)
2. **Criteria** — How you evaluated options (transparency = trust)
3. **Comparison table** — Side-by-side view of options (include your product fairly)
4. **Individual sections** — Each option with pros, cons, best for whom
5. **FAQ** — 5–10 common questions with direct answers
6. **Conclusion / Summary** — Short recap and recommendation

## What AI likes

- **Clear criteria** — "We evaluated on pricing, features, support" — explains the logic
- **Comparisons** — Head-to-head formats match "X vs Y" and "best X" prompts
- **FAQs** — Direct answers to "how to choose," "what's the difference"
- **Structure** — Headings, lists, tables; easy to parse
- **Balance** — Include alternatives; pure self-promotion gets ignored

<Info>
  **Avoid:** Thin content, no criteria, only your product. AI prefers useful roundups.
