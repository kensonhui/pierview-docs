## What playbooks are

**Playbooks** are step-by-step workflows that turn Pierview insights into actions. Instead of "you have low citations" (so what?), a playbook tells you exactly what to do: which sources to target, what content to create, how to measure success.

## The loop: Diagnose → Plan → Execute → Measure

1. **Diagnose** — Use Pierview to identify the gap: visibility, sentiment, citations, or competitor position.
2. **Plan** — Choose the right playbook and gather inputs (prompts, sources, competitors).
3. **Execute** — Follow the steps: create content, do outreach, optimize listings.
4. **Measure** — Rescan and compare. Iterate or move to the next priority.

## How to choose a playbook

| If your gap is... | Playbook |
|-------------------|----------|
| Competitor outranks you on key prompts | [Outrank a competitor on Perplexity](/playbooks/outrank-competitor-perplexity) |
| AI cites sources where you don't appear | [Turn source gaps into a PR pitch](/playbooks/source-gaps-pr-pitch) |
| Low citation rate, need more citeable content | [Create a Best X page that earns citations](/playbooks/best-x-page-citations) |
