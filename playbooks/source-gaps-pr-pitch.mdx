title: "Turn Source Gaps into a PR Pitch"
description: "Select sources, extract angles, build proof asset, use email template"

## Purpose

AI cites certain publications and directories often. If you're not in them, that's a **source gap**. This playbook turns that gap into a PR pitch — with a concrete angle and proof.

## Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select sources">

From Pierview, identify 2–3 high-Used sources (domains AI cites frequently) where you don't appear. Prioritize editorial (publications, blogs) over directories for this playbook.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Extract angles">

Review recent articles from those sources. What do they cover? Roundups, expert quotes, data studies, how-tos? Find an angle that fits your product and their editorial style.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Build proof asset">

Create something pitchable: a data point, survey, comparison, or expert perspective. "We found X" or "Here's how Y compares" works better than "please feature us."

  </Step>

  <Step title="Draft and send">

Use the template below. Personalize the subject and opener. Keep it short.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Email template

```
Subject: [Angle] — data/angle for your [topic] coverage

Hi [Name],

I noticed your recent piece on [topic] and thought you might find this useful for future coverage.

[1–2 sentences on your proof asset: data, angle, or resource.]

Example: "We ran the numbers on [X] and found [Y]. Happy to share the full data or a quote if helpful."

[1 sentence on relevance to their audience.]

Happy to chat or send over the asset. No pressure if it's not a fit.

Best,
[Your name]
```

<Info>
  **Pro tip:** Lead with value (the angle/asset), not your product. The goal is to be cited — which happens when you add something useful.
