title: "Outrank a Competitor on Perplexity"
description: "Workflow to find source gaps, build content, secure mentions, and measure"
---

## Purpose

Use this playbook when a competitor appears more often than you for key prompts (e.g., on Perplexity). You'll identify *why* they win (sources, content) and build a plan to close the gap.

## Inputs

- **Competitor** — The brand that outranks you
- **Prompts** — 5–10 prompts where they lead (from Pierview scan)
- **Sources** — Pierview's source breakdown: which domains cite the competitor but not you

## Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find source gaps">

Run a scan for your target prompts. In Pierview, compare your citations vs. the competitor's. List sources that cite them frequently but rarely (or never) cite you.

**Output:** A ranked list of source gaps (e.g., TechCrunch, G2, Capterra).

  </Step>

  <Step title="Build content">

Create or update content that fills the gap:
- If it's a directory → optimize your listing, get more reviews
- If it's editorial → create a citeable asset (data, expert take) you can pitch
- If it's your site → create a "Best X" or comparison page (see [Best X playbook](/playbooks/best-x-page-citations))

**Output:** Content brief + 1–2 assets ready for distribution.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Secure mentions">

- Submit to directories, pitch editors, contribute to roundups
- Use your proof asset (study, comparison, data) as the hook
- Follow up; persistence pays for PR

**Output:** Outreach plan + sent pitches.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Measure">

Rescan in 2–4 weeks. Compare:
- Visibility (your share vs. competitor)
- Citations (new sources citing you)
- Sentiment (any change in tone)

**Output:** Measurement checklist — before/after metrics.

  </Step>
