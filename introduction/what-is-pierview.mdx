## Product overview

Pierview AI is an **AI visibility platform** that tracks how your brand appears in AI-generated answers across large language models (LLMs). When users ask ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, or similar tools for recommendations, Pierview measures:

- **Visibility** — How often your brand is mentioned
- **Sentiment** — Whether mentions are positive, neutral, or negative
- **Citations** — Which sources AI references (your site, press, directories, etc.)
- **Competitors** — Who else shows up and how they compare

## How Pierview collects data

Pierview simulates user queries against AI models and analyzes the responses. The process is:

- **Query-based:** We send the prompts you define (e.g., "best project management tools") and capture the full response.
- **Structured analysis:** We extract brand mentions, sentiment, and citation URLs from each answer.
- **Aggregated metrics:** Results are rolled up into visibility rates, sentiment scores, and citation counts.

No sensitive user data is collected. We focus on public AI outputs and the sources they reference.
