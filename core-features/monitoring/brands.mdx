## Add brand variants

Your brand may appear in different forms: "Pierview," "Pierview AI," "Pier View." Add **variants** so we capture all mentions. Missing a common spelling means undercounting visibility.

**Tips:**
- Include the legal name and common abbreviations
- Add product names if they’re used in AI answers
- Avoid terms that match unrelated brands (e.g., generic words)

## Domain matching

Pierview can match your owned domains (e.g., pierview.ai, blog.pierview.ai) to citations. When AI cites your site, we attribute it to your brand. Configure domains in brand settings so citation metrics reflect your owned properties.

## Tracking competitors

Add competitor brands to compare visibility and sentiment side by side. Use the same prompt set for your brand and competitors — you’ll see who appears more often and how sentiment differs.

**Use cases:**
- Share of Answer: your share of total brand mentions
- Competitor source gaps: sources that cite them but not you
- Sentiment comparison: who gets more positive coverage

## Avoid ambiguity

- **Spelling:** Ensure variants are spelled correctly. Typos won’t match.
- **Overlap:** If "Acme" could mean Acme Corp or Acme Tools, add both and label clearly.
- **Generics:** "Best" or "Top" as a brand will create noise. Stick to real brand names.
