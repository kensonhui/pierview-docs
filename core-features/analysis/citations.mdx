## What counts as a citation

A **citation** is a source URL or reference that an AI model includes in its answer. When Perplexity says "According to [G2](https://g2.com/...)," that's a citation. We capture the URL, attribute it to a source/domain, and count how often it appears.

**Citation rate** — Percentage of responses that include at least one citation to your site:

$$
\text{Citation Rate} = \frac{\text{Responses with your URL}}{\text{Total Chats}} \times 100
$$

**Average citations** — How many times your URL (or a source) is cited per response:

$$
\text{Avg Citations} = \frac{\text{Total Citations}}{\text{Responses}}
$$

## Why citation quality matters

Citations are an **authority signal**. When AI cites your site, reviews, or press:

- Users trust the answer more
- You get referral traffic
- You build brand credibility

High visibility with zero citations means you’re mentioned but not backed by sources. That’s weaker than appearing *with* a citation to your content or reviews.

## How to improve citations

**Onsite:**
- Create **citeable pages**: "Best X" lists, comparisons, how-to guides, FAQs
- Use clear structure: headings, criteria, pros/cons
- Add schema (FAQ, HowTo) to help AI parse your content
- Avoid thin or purely promotional pages

**Offsite:**
- Get listed on directories (G2, Capterra) and encourage reviews
- Earn press and backlinks from publications AI cites
- Participate in communities (Reddit, etc.) where helpful answers get cited
- Build relationships with editors for roundups and expert quotes

  **Pro tip:** Check which pages from your site get cited. Double down on that format (e.g., comparison pages) and create more like them.
