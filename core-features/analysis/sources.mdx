## Sources vs citations

- **Citation** — A specific URL or reference the AI includes in its answer (e.g., `https://g2.com/products/pierview/reviews`).
- **Source** — The domain or site behind that citation (e.g., `g2.com`). Sources roll up multiple URLs.

Pierview shows both: which exact URLs get cited and which domains appear most often. Use **domain view** for strategy (which sites to target) and **URL view** for tactical checks (which pages earn citations).

## Key metrics: Used and Avg Citations

<MetricsCallout />

- **Used** — How many responses include at least one citation from this source. High Used = AI trusts this source frequently.
  - Example: G2 appears in 8 of 10 responses → Used = 8

- **Avg Citations** — Average number of times this source is cited per response. Higher = more prominent.
  - Formula: $\text{Avg Citations} = \frac{\text{Total citations from source}}{\text{Responses}}$

**Why it matters:** Sources with high Used but low Avg Citations are still important — they’re consistent. Sources with high Avg Citations dominate answers. Target both for content and PR.

## Source-type strategies

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Editorial (news, blogs, publications)">
    High authority. Pitch PR, contribute expert quotes, get featured in roundups. Create content that journalists and editors want to cite.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Corporate / Directories">
    G2, Capterra, your site. Optimize directory listings and create citeable pages (comparisons, FAQs, how-tos) on your domain.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="UGC (reviews, forums, communities)">
    Reddit, Trustpilot, etc. Encourage reviews and participate where it makes sense. UGC often appears in "what people say" answers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reference (Wikipedia, encyclopedias)">
    Harder to influence but high trust. Consider Wikipedia presence for established brands; avoid promotional editing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Your website">
    Your domain. Focus on clear criteria, comparisons, FAQs, and structured content. See [Create a Best X page](/playbooks/best-x-page-citations).

## Action loop: Insight → Action → Measure → Iterate

1. **Insight** — Identify source gaps: domains AI cites often where you don’t appear.
2. **Action** — Content (create citeable pages), PR (pitch those publications), directories (optimize listings).
3. **Measure** — Run scans and track Used, Avg Citations, and your share over time.
4. **Iterate** — Double down on what works. Adjust prompts and sources as the market shifts.
