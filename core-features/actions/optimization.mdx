## From insights to actions

Pierview surfaces visibility, sentiment, citations, and source gaps. The next step is turning that into **concrete actions**. Use this flow:

1. **Interpret** — What does the data say? Low visibility? Weak citations? Competitor ahead?
2. **Prioritize** — Focus on the biggest gap first (e.g., citation rate if you’re mentioned but never cited).
3. **Act** — Execute onsite or offsite changes.
4. **Measure** — Rescan and compare to baseline.

## Onsite actions

Create content and structure that AI can cite:

| Action | Why it works |
|--------|--------------|
| **Citeable pages** | "Best X," comparisons, how-tos, FAQs — structured content AI prefers |
| **FAQs** | Direct answers to common questions; often pulled into responses |
| **Comparisons** | "X vs Y" pages match common prompt patterns |
| **Schema markup** | FAQ, HowTo, Article — helps AI parse and attribute |
| **Clear criteria** | Explain *why* something is recommended; AI likes reasoning |

## Offsite actions

Build presence where AI already cites:

| Action | Why it works |
|--------|--------------|
| **PR outreach** | Pitch publications that appear in source lists; get featured in roundups |
| **Directories** | G2, Capterra, etc. — optimize listings, encourage reviews |
| **Communities** | Helpful answers on Reddit, Quora can get cited |
| **Expert contributions** | Quotes in articles, guest posts on authority sites |

## Optimization checklist

- [ ] Identify top sources AI cites for your category
- [ ] List source gaps (cited often, you’re absent)
- [ ] Create or update 1–2 citeable pages (Best X, comparison, FAQ)
- [ ] Add/improve schema on key pages
- [ ] Submit or optimize directory listings
- [ ] Draft PR pitch for 1–2 high-Used publications
- [ ] Rescan in 2–4 weeks and compare metrics
