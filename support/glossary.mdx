## A–C

**Avg Citations** — Average number of times a source (or your URL) is cited per AI response. Formula: Total citations / Responses. Higher = more prominent.

**Baseline** — Your initial visibility, sentiment, or citation metrics before making changes. Used for before/after comparison.

**Brand mention** — An occurrence of your brand name in an AI-generated answer. We count and attribute these per prompt and model.

**Brand variant** — Alternative spellings or forms of your brand (e.g., "Pierview," "Pierview AI"). Add variants so we capture all mentions.

**Citation** — A source URL or reference that an AI model includes in its answer. When AI links to a page, that's a citation. We track URLs and domains.

**Citation rate** — Percentage of responses that include at least one citation to your site. Formula: (Responses with your URL / Total Chats) × 100.

## M–P

**Model/platform** — The AI system being queried, e.g., ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude. Results vary by model.

**Prompt** — A query sent to an AI model to simulate user search intent. Examples: "best CRM for startups," "HubSpot vs Salesforce."

**Prompt set** — A group of related prompts tracked together, e.g., all "best X" prompts for your category.

**Prompt hygiene** — Best practices for prompt design: avoid too broad, avoid purely branded, balance patterns.

## S–V

**Scan** — A single run of your prompts against selected AI models. Produces visibility, sentiment, and citation metrics.

**Sentiment** — The tone of a brand mention: positive, neutral, or negative. Aggregated across responses.

**Share of Answer** — Your brand's share of total brand mentions in a response when competitors are tracked. E.g., 3 of 5 brands mentioned = 60% share.

**Source** — The domain or site behind a citation (e.g., g2.com, techcrunch.com). Sources roll up multiple URLs for strategy.

**Source gap** — A domain that AI frequently cites but where you don't yet appear. An opportunity for content or PR.

**Tracking period** — The time window for a scan or comparison, e.g., last 7 days, last 30 days.

**Used** — How many AI responses include at least one citation from a given source. High Used = AI trusts that source often.

**Visibility** — The percentage of AI responses (for your prompts) that mention your brand. Formula: (Mentions / Total Chats) × 100.
