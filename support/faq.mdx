## General

**What is Pierview AI?**  
Pierview is an AI visibility platform that tracks how your brand appears in AI-generated answers (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, etc.). You get visibility, sentiment, and citation metrics to monitor and improve your presence.

**Who is Pierview for?**  
Brand managers, content strategists, PR teams, and marketers who need to understand and improve how their brand shows up when users ask AI for recommendations.

**How does Pierview collect data?**  
We simulate user queries against AI models and analyze the responses. We extract brand mentions, sentiment, and citation URLs. No sensitive user data is collected.

## Metrics & visibility

**What is visibility?**  
The percentage of AI responses (for your prompts) that mention your brand. Formula: Mentions / Total Chats × 100.

**What is sentiment?**  
The tone of mentions: positive, neutral, or negative. We aggregate across responses.

**What are citations?**  
URLs or sources that AI includes in its answer. When AI says "According to G2" and includes a link, that's a citation. We track which sites get cited and how often.

**What's the difference between a source and a citation?**  
A citation is a specific URL. A source is the domain (e.g., g2.com) that groups multiple citations. Sources help you see which sites AI trusts most.

**What is "Used"?**  
How many responses include at least one citation from a given source. High Used = AI cites that source often.

**What is Avg Citations?**  
Average number of times a source is cited per response. Formula: Total citations from source / Responses.

## Prompts & brands

**How many prompts should I add?**  
Start with 5–10 per category. Add more for stability. Include a mix of "best X," "X vs Y," and "how-to" patterns.

**Should I add branded prompts?**  
Yes, for sentiment tracking. But include unbranded prompts too — they show discovery and share of category.

**How do I add a competitor?**  
Add their brand name (and variants) in brand settings. Use the same prompt set. You'll see visibility and sentiment comparison.

## Actions & playbooks

**How often should I scan?**  
Weekly for active work, monthly for trends. Consistency matters — same day each week if possible.

**How long until I see results from content/PR changes?**  
Allow 2–4 weeks. AI indexing and model updates take time. Rescan to compare before/after.

**Which playbook do I use?**  
- Competitor ahead → [Outrank competitor](/playbooks/outrank-competitor-perplexity)  
- Source gaps → [PR pitch](/playbooks/source-gaps-pr-pitch)
