## Four steps to first results

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add your brand">

Add your primary brand name. Include common variants (e.g., "Pierview" and "Pierview AI") so we catch all mentions. You can add competitors later for comparison.

<Info>
  **Tip:** Use exact spellings. Avoid overly broad terms that could match other brands.
</Info>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create prompt sets">

Define prompts that reflect real user queries. Think: "best X for Y," "X vs Y," "how to choose X." Start with 5–10 prompts per category.

**Examples:** "best AI visibility tools," "how to track brand mentions in ChatGPT," "Pierview vs manual monitoring"

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run your first scan">

Select your prompts and models (e.g., Perplexity, ChatGPT). Run the scan. Results typically return within a few minutes.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Review metrics and next steps">

Check your **Visibility**, **Sentiment**, and **Citations**. These tell you where you stand and what to improve.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why these metrics matter

- **Visibility** — If you're rarely mentioned, you're invisible. Aim to appear in a higher share of relevant answers.
  - Formula: <Latex>{"\\text{Visibility} = \\frac{\\text{Mentions}}{\\text{Total Chats}} \\times 100"}</Latex>

- **Sentiment** — Mentions alone aren't enough. Negative or neutral sentiment needs content or PR work.
  - Track positive vs negative share over time.

- **Citations** — When AI cites your site, reviews, or press, you gain authority and traffic. Citations are a leading indicator of trust.
  - Formula: <Latex>{"\\text{Avg Citations} = \\frac{\\text{Total Citations}}{\\text{Responses}}"}</Latex>

<Info>
  **Pro tip:** Low visibility + strong sentiment when you *are* mentioned suggests a distribution problem. High visibility + weak citations suggests you need more citeable content.
</Info>

## What to do next

Your scan outcomes point to different actions:

| Outcome | Next step |
|---------|-----------|
| Low visibility | Add more prompts, check brand variants, review [optimization](/core-features/actions/optimization) |
| Weak sentiment | Improve content quality, address negative mentions, see [Citations](/core-features/analysis/citations) |
| Few citations | Build citeable pages, target [source gaps](/core-features/analysis/sources), run a [playbook](/playbooks/overview) |
| Competitor ahead | Use [Outrank competitor](/playbooks/outrank-competitor-perplexity) playbook |
