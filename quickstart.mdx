## Four steps to first results

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add your brand">

Add your primary brand name. Include common variants (e.g., "Pierview" and "Pierview AI") so we catch all mentions. You can add competitors later for comparison.

<Info>
  **Tip:** Use exact spellings. Avoid overly broad terms that could match other brands.
</Info>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create prompt sets">

Define prompts that reflect real user queries. Think: "best X for Y," "X vs Y," "how to choose X." Start with 5–10 prompts per category.

**Examples:** "best AI visibility tools," "how to track brand mentions in ChatGPT," "Pierview vs manual monitoring"

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run your first scan">

Select your prompts and models (e.g., Perplexity, ChatGPT). Run the scan. Results typically return within a few minutes.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Review metrics and next steps">

Check your **Visibility**, **Sentiment**, and **Citations**. These tell you where you stand and what to improve.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why these metrics matter

- **Visibility** — If you're rarely mentioned, you're invisible. Aim to appear in a higher share of relevant answers.
  - $\text{Visibility} = \frac{\text{Mentions}}{\text{Total Chats}} \times 100$

- **Sentiment** — Mentions alone aren't enough. Negative or neutral sentiment needs content or PR work.
  - Track positive vs negative share over time.

- **Citations** — When AI cites your site, reviews, or press, you gain authority and traffic. Citations are a leading indicator of trust.
  - Formula: $\text{Avg Citations} = \frac{\text{Total Citations}}{\text{Responses}}$

<Info>
  **Pro tip:** Low visibility + strong sentiment when you *are* mentioned suggests a distribution problem. High visibility + weak citations suggests you need more citeable content.
