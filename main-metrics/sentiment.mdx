Sentiment measures **how AI platforms describe your brand** when you show up in answers — positive, neutral, or negative.

<Info>
Pierview is built for AI search outcomes: getting mentioned, improving ranking, and closing the visibility gap across AI search platforms. Sentiment is the “quality control” layer — it tells you whether your visibility is helping you… or quietly sabotaging you.

## What this metric answers

Use Sentiment to answer:

- **Are we being recommended, or just referenced?**
- **Do competitors get “trusted” language while we get “fine, I guess”?**
- **Which prompts create negative framing so we can fix the narrative?**
- **Did a launch / PR moment / new content change perception over time?**

## How Pierview measures sentiment

Pierview analyzes the language around your brand mention in each AI response and classifies it as:

- **Positive** — recommendations, praise, favorable comparisons  
- **Neutral** — factual mentions without clear judgment  
- **Negative** — criticism, warnings, or unfavorable comparisons  

### What we look for
- **Descriptive language**: “reliable”, “trusted”, “best for”, “limited”, “expensive”
- **Comparative framing**: “better than”, “worse than”, “not as good as”
- **Context cues**: pricing objections, missing features, support concerns, complexity

<Info>
Sentiment isn’t “vibes.” It’s positioning. AI models often mirror the tone of the sources they rely on — so improving sentiment usually starts with improving what the web says about you.

## Interpreting sentiment

Think of sentiment like this:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Positive" icon="circle-check">
    AI describes you as a strong choice (often recommended).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Neutral" icon="minus-circle">
    You appear, but language is cautious or purely factual.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Negative" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    AI highlights drawbacks or warns users away (fix this first).
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

If you display a score (0–100), a practical read is:

- **80–100**: strong recommendation language  
- **60–79**: okay/neutral framing (you’re in the convo, not the default)  
- **0–59**: risk zone (users get reasons *not* to choose you)

## Why sentiment matters in AI search

Pierview focuses on improving how you show up in AI-driven discovery. Sentiment matters because:

- **It affects trust**: users don’t just want mentions — they want confidence.
- **It shapes conversions**: “recommended” converts better than “mentioned.”
- **It changes competitive outcomes**: when two brands are both visible, sentiment often decides the winner.

## What drives sentiment

The biggest drivers are usually:

1. **Source narrative**: what high-authority pages say about you (reviews, lists, editorial)
2. **Message clarity**: “best for X” vs vague positioning that invites doubt
3. **Comparison context**: when competitors define the criteria, you can lose by default
4. **Freshness**: sentiment can decay if old pages and old opinions dominate citations

## How to improve sentiment (actionable checklist)

### Fast wins (this week)
- Add an **Objections FAQ** (pricing, setup, accuracy, limitations)
- Tighten your “best for” statement across key pages and profiles
- Fix mismatched claims across your site vs directories (AI hates inconsistencies)

### Compounding wins (this month)
- Publish **comparison pages** (fair criteria, clear tradeoffs)
- Get featured in roundups/listicles in your category (these often influence AI recommendations)
- Identify sources driving negative language, then:
  - update/clarify your own content
  - correct outdated third-party descriptions
  - create a credible “proof” asset (benchmark, methodology, case study)

## Troubleshooting

### Sentiment is negative on only a few prompts
    Those prompts usually map to one objection (pricing, complexity, missing feature).
    Create one targeted page that addresses that objection directly, then monitor changes over time.

### Sentiment is neutral everywhere
    You’re present but not differentiated.
    Add proof points: specific outcomes, “best for” clarity, and comparison criteria that you win on.

### Sentiment dropped suddenly

Check for a new high-impact source (review, blog post, community thread) that started showing up.
    Pierview’s tracking over time helps you spot competitor shifts and source changes.
