## Overview

AI answers often mention multiple brands. When you’re **mentioned first**, you’re more likely to be remembered, clicked, and chosen — especially in list-style recommendations (“Top tools for…”, “Best options for…”).

Position helps you track:
- **Order of mention** in list-style answers
- Whether you’re framed as a **top pick** vs “also-ran”
- How often you **lead vs follow** competitors

---

## How position is measured

Pierview assigns a **rank** to each brand mention inside an answer:

- **Rank 1** = first brand mentioned
- **Rank 2** = second brand mentioned
- etc.

Then Pierview aggregates across your selected timeframe:

### Average Position

$$
AvgPosition = \frac{\sum Rank_{brand}}{N}
$$

Where:
- $Rank_{brand}$ = your rank in a response where you’re mentioned
- $N$ = number of responses where your brand appears

<Info>
Position is calculated only on responses where you appear. If you don’t appear, that’s a Visibility problem — not a Position problem.
</Info>

## How to interpret position

A simple rubric:

- **1.0 – 1.5**: You’re often the default recommendation 🏆  
- **1.6 – 2.5**: You’re competitive (in the top group)  
- **2.6 – 4.0**: You show up, but late (people may not reach you)  
- **4.0+**: You’re “honorable mention” territory

## Why position matters

### Brand authority
A lower (better) position suggests AI models treat you as:
- A **more authoritative** option for the topic
- A **go-to** choice in your category
- A strong match for the user intent

### Competitive advantage
Better position usually means:
- Users see you first → higher selection probability
- Your brand framing controls the comparison
- Competitors become the “alternatives” (not you)

### Topic relevance
Position varies by topic and intent. This helps you find:
- Topics where you’re already a leader
- Topics where your messaging/content needs work
- Prompt clusters where competitors dominate first mention

## What drives position

Position is mostly influenced by:

1. **Prompt intent fit**  
   If the prompt maps to a use case you own, you tend to rank earlier.

2. **Source strength**  
   AI models often pull lists and comparisons from authoritative sources. If those sources lead with competitors, you’ll show up later.

3. **Clarity of differentiation**  
   Brands with clear “best for X” positioning usually rank earlier.

4. **Comparison availability**  
   If there are many “X vs Y” pages about competitors, they get “first mention momentum.”

## How to improve position (action checklist)

### Fast wins (this week)
- Add more **high-intent prompts**:
  - “best [category] for [use case]”
  - “[competitor] vs [your brand]”
  - “alternatives to [competitor]”
- Tighten your **positioning sentence** everywhere:
  - “Pierview is best for ___ teams who want ___ outcome.”
- Create a short **comparison page** for your top competitor.

### Compounding wins (this month)
- Build content formats that commonly produce “ranked lists” in AI answers:
  - “Best X” pages with criteria
  - “Alternatives to X” pages
  - Comparisons with structured sections (pricing, features, ideal user)
- Improve your presence on the **sources** AI relies on:
  - directories, review sites, editorial roundups, communities

<Info>
If you want to win position, don’t just “exist on the web” — exist on the *pages that define the ranking*.

## Troubleshooting

### We have good visibility but poor position
    - You’re being mentioned, but not framed as a top recommendation  
    - Check whether competitors are described with stronger “best for” language  
    - Improve positioning and comparison content, then track position on the same prompt set

### Position looks inconsistent across prompts
    - That’s normal: some topics naturally favor competitors  
    - Group prompts into clusters (use cases) and optimize one cluster at a time

### We're ranked late even when we should be a top fit

- Look at the sources driving those answers
- If the top-used sources are missing you, you’ll rarely rank early  
- Fix source presence first, then re-check position
