description: How Pierview measures how often your brand is mentioned in AI answers.

<Info>
Think of Visibility as your “AI shelf space.” If buyers ask an AI for recommendations and you’re not mentioned, you’re not in the aisle.

## What this metric answers

Use Visibility to answer:

- **Do we appear in high-intent AI answers?**
- **Which prompt topics do we win (see) vs lose (don’t show up)?**
- **Are competitors consistently mentioned instead of us?**
- **Did content, PR, or a product launch change our presence over time?**

---

## How Visibility is calculated

At a basic level:

<div style={{ textAlign: "center", margin: "1.5rem 0" }}>
  $$Visibility = \frac{\text{Mentions}}{\text{Total Chats}} \times 100$$
</div>


Where:
- **Mentions** = number of AI responses where your brand appears
- **TotalChats** = total AI responses collected for your tracked prompts during the selected timeframe

<Info>
Visibility is calculated over your selected time range (e.g., last 7 days). Changing the range changes the denominator—so compare apples to apples.

## What counts as a “mention”?

Pierview counts a mention when:

- Your brand name appears in the answer text (including accepted variants)
- The mention is about *your brand* (not a different company with a similar name)

Pierview does *not* count a mention when:

- Your brand only appears in a cited URL, but not in the answer text (that’s **Source Visibility**, not Brand Visibility)
- Your brand appears as part of a generic word (common with ambiguous brand names)

### Edge cases and examples

- **Ambiguous names:** If your brand name is a common word, add variants (domain, product name).
    - **List answers:** If the AI returns a list of tools and includes you once, that counts as a mention.
- **Repeated mentions:** Multiple mentions in the same answer still count as one “mentioned in this chat.”

## How to interpret Visibility

Here’s a practical rubric (adjust expectations by category maturity):

- **0–5%**: You’re mostly invisible → biggest upside.
- **5–20%**: You show up sometimes → not yet a default pick.
- **20–40%**: You’re competitive → consistently in the conversation.
- **40%+**: You’re a category staple → maintain and protect.

<Info>
If Visibility is high but conversions aren’t improving, check **Sentiment** and **Position/Average Ranking**. Being mentioned isn’t the same as being recommended.
</Info>

## Why Visibility matters

Visibility is a leading indicator for:

- **Brand discovery:** AI is now a discovery channel, not just a chat tool.
- **Competitive share:** If you’re not mentioned, someone else is.
- **Market positioning:** Visibility tends to correlate with category authority and content presence.

## What drives Visibility (the levers)

The biggest contributors:

1. **Prompt fit:** Are you tracking prompts where you *should* show up?
2. **Source presence:** Are you included on the websites AI uses to answer?
3. **Content coverage:** Do you have pages that directly address the prompt intent?
4. **Authority signals:** Do credible third parties mention you (directories, reviews, editorial)?

## How to improve Visibility (actionable checklist)

### Fast wins (today)
- Add **comparison prompts** (“X vs Y”) to force competitive context.
- Add brand **variants** and your **domain** to avoid missed mentions.
- Identify the top 5 prompts with the lowest visibility and rewrite them to be more specific.

### Compounding wins (this month)
- Create “AI-citeable” content formats:
  - **Best X** pages with clear criteria
  - **Alternatives** pages
  - **Comparisons** (X vs Y)
  - **FAQs** that answer common prompt phrasing
- Target source gaps:
  - Get listed where competitors are listed (directories)
  - Pitch editorial sources that dominate your category
  - Participate in communities that models rely on (UGC)

## Troubleshooting: when Visibility looks wrong

### Visibility is 0%

- Prompts might be too broad  
- Brand variants missing
- Your category keywords may not match prompt intent
- Try adding 5 more high-intent prompts and rerun

### We're cited but not mentioned

- Your content is being used as a source  
- But your brand is not “named” in the response  
- Fix by adding clearer brand attribution on-page (about section, product naming, consistent mentions)
