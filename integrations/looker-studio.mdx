## Looker Studio connector

Pierview can connect to **Looker Studio** (formerly Google Data Studio) so you can build custom dashboards and reports using your visibility, sentiment, and citation data.

This integration is coming soon. When available, you will be able to:

- Link your Pierview account to Looker Studio
- Pull metrics into custom dashboards
- Combine AI visibility data with other marketing and business data

Check the [changelog](/support/changelog) or contact support for release updates.
