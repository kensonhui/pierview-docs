## Placeholder

<Note>
  **Placeholder.** Authentication details will be published when the API is available. No secrets or credentials are documented here.
</Note>

## Expected approach

The Pierview API will likely use:

- **API key** — Passed in a header (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`) or as a query parameter for server-side requests
- **Scoped access** — Keys may be restricted to specific resources (e.g., a project or workspace)

## Security

- Never expose API keys in client-side code or public repos
- Rotate keys periodically
- Use environment variables or secret managers for storage

## Next steps

- See [API Overview](/api-reference/introduction)
- Browse [Endpoints](/api-reference/endpoints) (placeholder)
